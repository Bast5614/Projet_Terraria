# Project_Terra
A little 2D sandbox game, heavily inspired by Minecraft and Terraria (maybe the title gave it away ?),

here is a little [video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT99sOy5-_U) !

## Context
This game was written in Java using the framework libGDX.

It was a 6 weeks project, made to validate our L3 Informatique in the University of Rennes 1.

Feel free to contribute to the project, the code architecture is described [here](DESIGN.md).

To install or build from source, see [this](INSTALL.md) document.
