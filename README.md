# Project_Terra
A little 2D sandbox game, heavily inspired by Minecraft and Terraria (maybe the title gave it away ?),

here is a little [video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT99sOy5-_U) !

## Context
This game was written in Java using the framework libGDX.

It was a 6 weeks project, made to validate our L3 Informatique in the University of Rennes 1.

Feel free to contribute to the project, the code architecture is described [here](DESIGN.md).

To install or build from source, see [this](INSTALL.md) document.

## Controls
| Key | Effect | 
| :-: |:------:| 
| Q & D  | move left and right |  
| Space / Z | jump |   
| E      | open inventory |    
| Left Click | break tile |
| Right Click | put tile / use item |

## Content
Future features to implement :

- Rework light and implement torches (or other light sources)
- Implement items that add crafts (Terraria style) (such as craft-tables and/or furnace)
- Ability to craft/destroy/put background tiles
- Implements liquids (water/lava) (physics of the liquids, ability to swim/breath under water and generate ocean)
- Add durability to items
- Add options in pause menu (remap keys, change volume of music/sounds)
- Ability to handle multiple saves/maps in main menu 

*And of course there is always room to implement new mobs and items*
